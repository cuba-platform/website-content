## Overview
Designed from scratch, Helium theme provides a modern look and feel and customization capabilities.

## Features

- CSS variables are used for colors. As a result it's possible to apply different color presets on the fly, without theme recompilation and app restart.
- Built-in size presets (small/large/medium), also switchable in runtime.
- Persistent per-user color/size settings.
    - Settings screen (Help > Theme Settings).
    - Built-in helium-theme-minimal role to enable access to the settings screen.

## Browser compatibility
Helium works in the latest versions of modern browsers that support [CSS variables](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables).
IE 11 is not supported out of the box since it does not support CSS variables, though it is possible to use [polyfill](https://github.com/nuxodin/ie11CustomProperties).

## Limitations
Studio 14 is required to extend Helium without any manual actions.
