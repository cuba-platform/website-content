## Overview
A component that adds dynamic columns support (user created) for Table components. **NOTE:** only the web module is supported.

Basically, it provides a custom action that you can add to your table components, and associate to a button (or context menu item, or whatever you want) that when triggered display a dialog where the user can add/edit/remove dynamic columns whose value is generated by a Groovy script.
