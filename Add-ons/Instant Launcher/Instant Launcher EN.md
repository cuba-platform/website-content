## Overview
This application component lets you define launcher commands at runtime that can be directly executed via a search box.

Instant launcher uses [rich-search](https://github.com/cuba-platform/rich-search-addon) under the hood. It adds a specific search result type to the search results of `rich-search` called `Launcher Commands`. Those Launcher Commands are configurations or scripts that can be defined at the runtime of an application.
