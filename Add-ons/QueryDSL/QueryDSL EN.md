## Overview

The add-on provides [QueryDSL](http://www.querydsl.com/) integration for CUBA applications. QueryDSL enables the construction of unified type-safe database queries for Java. Instead of writing queries, you can use a fluent API.

See the [demo project](https://github.com/ikuchmin/querydsl-shop) using this add-on.

### Suggestions in IDE

QueryDSL provides suggestions in your IDE while writing queries in your CUBA application.

### Compilation

QueryDSL guarantees that the compiler will check that your database queries are type-safe. It also helps you adapt better to refactoring changes.

### Studio Compatibility

The add-on works with CUBA Studio 13.2 or later versions.
