## Overview

This CUBA component gives users a mailbox for user-to-user and system-to-user messages. Using this add-on allows you to notify users about certain events that happened within the application. Also, it is possible to let users send messages/notifications to other users. Using context-based messages, the user can link to particular business objects when sending messages.

## Features
- Direct user to user messaging
- Context-based messages
- System notifications

## Supported DBMS
- HSQLDB
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

All other DBMS systems are also possible to work with by the fact that CUBA Studio generates the corresponding init/update scripts within the application.
