## Overview
This add-on provides a readily available instrument of authentication in any CUBA-based application using SAML open standard. That allows an identity provider to pass authorization credentials to your applications â€” service providers.

The component enables Single Sign-On in your application. You log in once with the identity provider and this set of credentials will be used to log in your CUBA applications.

## Features
- Simplified authorization procedure for users and service providers.
- The ability to use one set of credentials to log in many applications, which centralizes user management.
- User interface to set up and configure SAML connections.
