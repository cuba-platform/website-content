## Overview
Masquerade is a set of libraries for automating user interface testing and ensuring regressions get caught. You can easily build tests that catch everything from UI changes to database quirks, maintain the test in any JVM language and run them manually or in your CI environment.

The library provides an ability to create UI tests for CUBA-based applications using masquerade-web module. Also, you can create REST-API tests with masquerade-connector module.

Based on:

*   Java
*   Selenide
*   Selenium
