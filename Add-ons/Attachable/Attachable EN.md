## Overview
This application component lets you easily add attachments to any entity in your application. Just add `@WithAttachments` on the browse screen of your entity and the rest will be done by this app-component.

This annotation will create a button in the buttonsPanel of the table and add the Attachments button after the default CUBA buttons. The Attachments button will show all attachments that have been added to a particular selected entity. It allows to add, edit & remove attachments to this entity. Furthermore it gives the user an option to preview the attachment directly in the browser or download the attachment.
