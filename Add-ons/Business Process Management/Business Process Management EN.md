## Overview
The BPM add-on is based on the popular Activiti framework.

NOTE: The add-on is deprecated. It is recommended to use the [BProc](https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/bproc/) add-on instead.

## Key features

*   Integrated visual designer
*   Integrated data model - Activiti data model is wrapped in CUBA entities, so you can easily use them in UI and business logic
*   Process forms - a convenient way to display process assignments and actions
*   UI to manage process designs, running instances and assignments
*   Sub-designs - existing process designs can be used as part of a larger process design
*   Localization
