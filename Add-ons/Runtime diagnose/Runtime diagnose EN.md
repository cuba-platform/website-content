## Overview
This application component can be used for interactive runtime application diagnose and debugging of a CUBA application. It is based on the idea of the [Grails console.](http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/console)

The component consists of three parts:

*   Interactive Groovy console
*   Interactive JPQL / SQL console
*   Non-interactive diagnose wizard, which facilitates executing scripts in a system where you do not have access to.
