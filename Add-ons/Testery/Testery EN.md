## Overview
Efficient exploratory testing with as much automation as possible. Have you ever felt the need to give your QA, business people as well as developers a mechanism to test your application(s) from the outside? Although you might have test automation in place, there is little visibility in the automated test suites that live somewhere in the CI server? Do you want to efficiently execute exploratory testing with as much automated help as possible?

Testery is a tool which allows you to exactly this. It enables business people as well as QA engineers to concentrate on the important stuff while doing exploratory testing instead of dealing with technical details.
