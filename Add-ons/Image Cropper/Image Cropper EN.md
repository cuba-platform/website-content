Description
This component will be helpful for processing an image to fit the application restriction.

## Overview 

In modern enterprise applications, uploading images is a popular requirement, for example, upload ID Card images, avatar images or image attachments, etc. Almost all applications have restrictions on image size in order to reduce upload time and stored file size.

Generally, if the original image does not fit the size requirement, we need to process the raw image to fit the application restriction. This component will be helpful for processing the original image.
