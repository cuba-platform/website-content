## Overview

The add-on gives you an ability to use [JavaMelody](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki) monitoring in CUBA applications. This tool helps you to measure and calculate statistics on a real operation of the application depending on the usage of the application by users. 

It is mainly based on statistics of requests and on evolution charts. The add-on helps you to give facts about average response times and a number of executions and make decisions to fix problems.

## Features

- Summary charts showing the evolution over time of Java memory and CPU, number of executions, and user sessions.
- Statistics of predefined counters: current HTTP requests, SQL requests, JSF actions, and JSP pages.
- Statistics on HTTP errors, on warnings and errors in logs, and on data caches.
