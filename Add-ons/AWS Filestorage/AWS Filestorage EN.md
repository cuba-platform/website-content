The add-on provides support of Amazon S3 file storage service out-of-the-box, that enables storing and protecting any amount of data.


## Overview 
The add-on provides support of [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) file storage service out-of-the-box, that enables storing and protecting any amount of data. You can use a cloud storage service instead of the standard file storage implementation. 

It is recommended to use a separate cloud file storage service for cloud deployments. The storage folder structure is organized similarly to the standard implementation.
