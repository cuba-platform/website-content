## Overview:
Interactive Tour add-on provides a possibility to create an interactive product tour on your CUBA Platform application screens. The product tour itself consists of steps, each with its own title, text, and some other configuration parameters. Moreover, each step can be attached to any UI component thus helping you to focus the user's attention.

## Features:
* Attachable to components: the tour steps can be attached to any UI component.
* Options: you can set various options for the single step (e.g. modality, text, title, anchor position, what buttons are shown, etc.).
* Events: the tour and steps fire different events for you to be able to react if needed (e.g. showing a step, completion of a tour, etc.)
