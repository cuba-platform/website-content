## Overview
Drop in replacement for VBoxLayout and HBoxLayout to make responsive web applications based on CSS Flexbox.

The add-on provides 3 UI components: ResponsiveLayout, ResponsiveLayout.Row, and ResponsiveLayout.Column. Essentially, it is a flexible column-based layout with 4 predefined breakpoints: XS (for phones), SM (for tablets), MD (for desktops), LG (for larger desktops).
